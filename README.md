## Notes

* This README was made for the sake of it, so it's pretty short and doesn't provide any useful information. Sorry.
* I choose this name for the project because it sounds cool, originally wasn't related to idea of the game.
* Only in Russian for now.
* Uses SQLite as a database.
* Most of the effort was put into helpers xD.
* This project is in a very early state, so don't mind lack of any story progression.
